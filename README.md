# Code---Enhancing-COVID-19-Fake-News-Detection-with-FastText-Embeddings-and-CNNs

This project focuses on detecting fake news related to COVID-19 using multiple machine learning and deep learning models. Special attention is given to enhancing performance using FastText word embeddings combined with a CNN architecture. A comparison between models using FastText embeddings and models without embeddings is also provided, including results after hyperparameter tuning.
Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an "infodemic" of fake news and misinformation. Accurate and efficient fake news detection models are essential to mitigate this impact.
In this project:
•	We leverage both traditional ML classifiers and deep learning models.
•	We compare performance with and without FastText embeddings.
•	We perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize our CNN model.
Dataset
We used the COVID-19 Fake News Infodemic Research Dataset (COVID19-FNIR Dataset), which contains:
•	News articles and social media posts
•	Labels: 0 for fake, 1 for real
Data preprocessing steps include:
•	Text cleaning (removing URLs, special characters)
•	Tokenization
•	Lowercasing
•	Stopword removal
•	Lemmatization

Models Used
We experimented with both traditional ML models and a CNN deep learning model.
Traditional Machine Learning Models:
•	 TF-IDF + Random Forest
•	 TF-IDF + Extra Trees
•	 TF-IDF + Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
•	 TF-IDF + Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Deep Learning Model:
•	 CNN (without embeddings)
•	 CNN + FastText Embeddings (enhanced model)

 Experiments
•	 Models were trained with and without FastText embeddings.
•	 Hyperparameter tuning was applied to the CNN models to optimize:
o	Filter sizes
o	Number of filters
o	Dropout rates
o	Learning rates
o	Optimizers (Adam, RMSProp, SGD)

Usage
1. Preprocess the Dataset

4. Evaluate Models
python evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.h5 --dataset data/test.csv

Hyperparameter Tuning
We applied hyperparameter tuning on CNN using:
•	Grid Search over filter sizes, dropout, learning rate
•	Optimizers: Adam, SGD, RMSProp
•	Batch sizes: 32, 64, 128
Result: Tuned CNN + FastText model significantly outperformed baseline models.
