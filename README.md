# Code---Enhancing-COVID-19-Fake-News-Detection-with-FastText-Embeddings-and-CNNs

This project focuses on detecting fake news related to COVID-19 using multiple machine learning and deep learning models. Special attention is given to enhancing performance using FastText word embeddings combined with a CNN architecture. A comparison between models using FastText embeddings and models without embeddings is also provided, including results after hyperparameter tuning.
Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an "infodemic" of fake news and misinformation. Accurate and efficient fake news detection models are essential to mitigate this impact.
In this project:
â€¢	We leverage both traditional ML classifiers and deep learning models.
â€¢	We compare performance with and without FastText embeddings.
â€¢	We perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize our CNN model.
Dataset
We used the COVID-19 Fake News Infodemic Research Dataset (COVID19-FNIR Dataset), which contains:
â€¢	News articles and social media posts
â€¢	Labels: 0 for fake, 1 for real
Data preprocessing steps include:
â€¢	Text cleaning (removing URLs, special characters)
â€¢	Tokenization
â€¢	Lowercasing
â€¢	Stopword removal
â€¢	Lemmatization

Models Used
We experimented with both traditional ML models and a CNN deep learning model.
Traditional Machine Learning Models:
â€¢	 TF-IDF + Random Forest
â€¢	 TF-IDF + Extra Trees
â€¢	 TF-IDF + Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
â€¢	 TF-IDF + Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Deep Learning Model:
â€¢	 CNN (without embeddings)
â€¢	 CNN + FastText Embeddings (enhanced model)
________________________________________
 Experiments
â€¢	 Models were trained with and without FastText embeddings.
â€¢	 Hyperparameter tuning was applied to the CNN models to optimize:
o	Filter sizes
o	Number of filters
o	Dropout rates
o	Learning rates
o	Optimizers (Adam, RMSProp, SGD)

Usage
1. Preprocess the Dataset
python preprocess.py --input data/raw.csv --output data/cleaned.csv
2. Train ML Models
python train_ml_models.py --dataset data/cleaned.csv
3. Train CNN + FastText
python train_cnn_fasttext.py --embedding_path data/cc.en.300.vec.gz --dataset data/cleaned.csv
4. Evaluate Models
python evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.h5 --dataset data/test.csv

Hyperparameter Tuning
We applied hyperparameter tuning on CNN using:
â€¢	Grid Search over filter sizes, dropout, learning rate
â€¢	Optimizers: Adam, SGD, RMSProp
â€¢	Batch sizes: 32, 64, 128
Result: Tuned CNN + FastText model significantly outperformed baseline models.
